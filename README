The colors of a Finnish autumn morning captured and packed in a nice color scheme which is light orange/blue/green and doesn't strain the eye.

This scheme was created to serve more as a tool for users who work with code such as C/C++ or Perl. Also handy with XHTML/HTML/CSS and why not plain text too.

Rich syntax highlightings, cterm supported.
